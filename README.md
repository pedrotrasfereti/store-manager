<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## RESTful API Using Express.js

Welcome to the _GitHub repository_ of my fifth back-end project, **Store Manager**!
Here you can find information about the project's development, such as which technologies were used, how to install and run the project, usage and more.

This back-end application was developed during my time at [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/) to practice the lessons learned on Express.js and REST architecture. It also uses a _multi-layered architecture_ â€” which in this case, are the _model_, _service_ and _controller_ layers.
This API is a sales management system, where you can create, view, delete and update products and sales. 

During the development I was able to:

* Understand the function of the **Model layer**;
* Delegate specific responsibilities to the **Model layer**;
* Connect my application to different **databases**;
* Improve the **maintainability** and **reusability** of my code;
* Understand and apply the **REST** constraints;
* Write **unit tests** for my modules using Chai, Mocha and Sinon;
* Write intuitive API signatures;

### Endpoints

A list of all endpoints and supported methods.

* **/products** - Using the `POST` HTTP method, allows the user to create a product with the following JSON structure:
```
{
  "name": "product_name",
  "quantity": "product_quantity"
}
```

The user may also list all products using the `GET` HTTP method;

<br />

* **/products/:id**

  * Using the `PUT` HTTP method, allows the user to edit a product with the provided `id` param and the following JSON structure:
  ```
  {
    "name": "new_product_name",
    "quantity": "new_product_quantity"
  }
  ```

  * The owner of the post may also delete a product using the `DELETE` HTTP method.

<br />

* **/sales** - Using the `POST` HTTP method, allows the user to create (multiple) sales with the following JSON structure:
```
[
  {
    "product_id": "product_id",
    "quantity": "product_quantity",
  }
]
```

The user may also list all sales using the `GET` HTTP method;

<br />

* **/sales/:id**

  * Using the `PUT` HTTP method, allows the user to edit a sale with the provided `id` param and the following JSON structure:
  ```
  [
    {
      "product_id": "id",
      "quantity": "new_quantity"
    }
  ]
  ```

  * The owner of the post may also delete a sale using the `DELETE` HTTP method.

<br />

### Tables

The MySQL schema will contain three tables: **products**, **sales** and **sales_products** (N:N).
